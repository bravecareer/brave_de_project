This is a sandbox project for exploring the basic functionality and latest features of dbt.

## Setup

### dbt Cloud IDE (most beginner friendly)

1. Setup instructions for dbt Cloud

### dbt Cloud in GitHub Codespaces (more customizable)

1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of the page to create a new repository from this template.
2. In the new repository, click the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown.

### dbt Core with DuckDB in GitHub Codespaces (think local, act global)

1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of the page to create a new repository from this template.
2. In the new repository, click the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces" from the dropdown.

### dbt Core with other platforms (choose your own adventure)

If you know what you're doing, you can use this repo with any local or cloud database with a dbt adapter. We can't offer support for this setup, but the general steps should be as follows:

1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of the page to create a new repository from this template.
2. Clone the new repository to your local machine or open it in a GitHub Codespace.
