Oct 13 - completed more or less first lab. the only thing which doesn't work is airflow. recent biggest advancement was that i managed to change tables in snowflake using dbt. the probem was that it was "materialized='incremental'", while it should be materialized='table', now it works. however airflow still doesn't work even though I checked bash command in new terminal window and it works.
Oct 13 upd - it doesn't make sense to stuck too long with airflow, so I'm moving on to next lab (even though it's similar). the plan is to get it done very quickly, then get really good understanding of data, and complete the project.
